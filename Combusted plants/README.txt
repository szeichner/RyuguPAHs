.txt files are RAW files that were processed with FTSTATISTIC or ISOX (propriety software managed by Thermo Fisher). Processed data can then be analyzed using the orbitrap data processing code: caltechorbi/OrbitrapDataProcessing: orbicodeV1.0.3. CaltechDATA (2021). https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.2170.![image](https://github.com/szeichner/RyuguPAHs/assets/25493173/e8a20822-7f3a-49ff-ab80-794c816e863a)
The all_output.csv and stats_output.csv files are the data products generated by that data processing code.

Raw files are divided into subfolders organized by: plant--> mass window-->PAH ring number

CombustedPlantDat_Sept2022_ForHB2.xlsx contains the processed compiled data and calculation of isotope ratios from the processed raw files.
