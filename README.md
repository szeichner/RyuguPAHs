Sub folders include raw files from Orbitrap measurements of PAHs from Ryugu, Murchison and combusted plant biomass.
There are also three xlsx files with processed data products included in the mansucript. Each sample type is processed in a separate xlsx file: "HB2_data_processed_08092023_v2" contains HB2 data, "Murchison_directElutionJME_reanalysis" contains Murchison data, and "Sept2022_FireProducts_checkedAug2023" contains combusted plant biomass data. Within each file, results that are included in the paper are within tabs that are labeled "FINAL".
