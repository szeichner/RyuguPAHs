Folder for raw and processed data from Murchison paper, originally published for Zeichner et al.,2022, in GCA.

.txt files are RAW files that were processed with FTSTATISTIC or ISOX (propriety software managed by Thermo Fisher). Processed data can then be analyzed using the orbitrap data processing code: caltechorbi/OrbitrapDataProcessing: orbicodeV1.0.3. CaltechDATA (2021). https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.2170.![image](https://github.com/szeichner/RyuguPAHs/assets/25493173/e8a20822-7f3a-49ff-ab80-794c816e863a)
The all_output.csv and stats_output.csv files are the data products generated by that data processing code.

Reanalyzed_Murchison_For_HB2.xlsx file contains processed data from all the .txt files and a demonstration of D2x13C values were computed.
